This sample take design and idea from this real product:
https://order.thecoffeehouse.com/m/

In this repo, I use [jumpstate](https://github.com/jumpsuit/jumpstate) as an
opinionated way to reduce Redux boilerplate code. Other than that, most of
things was built from scratch for the sake of comparison.

Also some tests of
[React 16](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html)'s features were
included (portal and fragment).

Implementation using Redux approach in oppose to
[Pure React Approach](https://github.com/quanla/pure-react-sample-coffee)

I am by no mean an expert or experienced developer. Feel free to send me
pull-request for improvements :D
